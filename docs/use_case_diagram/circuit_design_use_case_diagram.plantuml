note right of DesignCircuit
    primary workflow for creating and modifying
    quantum circuits within the composer environment
end note

note right of AddGate
    place quantum gate on circuit canvas at specified position,
    insert into DAG structure and push overlapping gates forward
end note

note right of EditGate
    modify gate configuration including type, parameters,
    target qubits, and control qubit assignments
end note

note right of MoveGate
    reposition gate on canvas to new qubit placement,
    update internal circuit structure accordingly
end note

note right of GroupGates
    combine multiple gates into composite circuit element,
    register new composite gate in gates panel for reuse
end note

note right of UngroupGates
    decompose composite circuit back into constituent gates,
    restore individual gates to circuit canvas layout
end note

note right of ImportQASM
    load OpenQASM code file, parse syntax,
    convert to circuit representation and render on canvas
end note

note right of AutoSaveCircuit
    automatically synchronize circuit state to backend storage,
    debounced at 1-second intervals during editing
end note
