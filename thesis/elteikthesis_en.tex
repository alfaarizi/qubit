I would like to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who has supported me throughout this thesis. This work was made possible through the generous support of the Quantum Information National Laboratory in Hungary, which awarded me the QNL Research Scholarship.

First and foremost, I am profoundly grateful to Professor Morse Gregory Reynolds for his invaluable guidance as my thesis advisor and personal mentor. His expertise, constructive feedback, and engaging debates proved as formative as any coursework. I am also deeply indebted to Dr. Péter Rakyta for his patient guidance in quantum research, whose explanations have directly enabled the technical contributions of this thesis.

I would like to extend my thanks to Dr. Máté Cserép András for his mentorship during my full-stack development internship, and to Dr. Pintér Balázs for entrusting me with teaching responsibilities.

To my family and Farah, thank you for your unwavering love and support. Your encouragement and belief in my abilities kept me motivated throughout my years at ELTE.

Finally, to my classmates and friends, thank you for the countless hours spent together. Your friendship and companionship made it all worthwhile.
